			logo: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/programming-languages-logos/src/javascript/javascript.png",
			details: "Architected a modular EaaS platform enabling schemaâ€‘driven rubrics (via JSON/YAML) and LLMâ€‘asâ€‘aâ€‘Judge scoring to assess reasoning, factual accuracy, hallucination, and tool usage. Added OpenTelemetry tracing for full agent trajectories (prompts, tool calls, state changes). Integrated NeMo Evaluator API for batch and CI/CD runs, with dashboarding (Weave) and autoâ€‘alerting on regression thresholds. Enabled evaluation-as-code that prevents subtle regressions pre-deployment, boosts developer confidence, and accelerates iterative model improvement, unifying evaluation with production workflows.",

			details: "Created a Neo4jâ€‘backed knowledge graph enriched by vector-indexed log chunks. Designed LLM prompts to extract entities, relationships, and causal chains. Enabled multi-hop queries like errors â†’ services â†’ root causes, combining semantic retrieval and graph algorithms to cluster similar incidents. Delivered a full pipeline within one weekend that accelerates triage, surfaces hidden failure modes, and reduces manual tagging effort. The project showcased how GraphRAG can bring structure and clarity to unstructured operational data.",

			details: "Developed a patientâ€‘facing avatar combining Nvidia Tokioâ€™s conversational interface and LLM prompting to interpret symptoms, ask clarifying questions, and log structured medical histories. Integrated voiceâ€‘toâ€‘text and backend medical API lookups. Included confidence scoring and fallback options for uncertain responses. Built interacting UI mockups and backend flows over a weekend to demonstrate empathetic virtual triage, reducing clinician load and enhancing engagement. The prototype showed promise for remote patient engagement and structured symptom collection.",

Reverseâ€‘engineered existing APIs, designed a GraphQL schema with nested queries and pagination, and implemented resolvers in Node.js/TypeScript. Achieved feature parity while reducing payload size by 60% and improving load times by 45%. Added automated schema validation and CI/CD integration to support future evolution. This migration improved clientâ€‘side efficiency, increased developer velocity, and set up a maintainable API framework for future features.",
